## About The Project

Welcome to Project Echo : Neon Wave, a rhythm game developed for arcade machines. This game is developed by a team of 7 students from Ynov school in Lyon, France.   
In this game, players are challenged to hit the notes and sliders that fall from the top of the screen in time with the music.

### Gameplay  

The gameplay mechanics of Project Echo: Neon Wave are similar to those of Guitar Hero.  
Notes fall from the top of the screen along a track, and the player must hit the corresponding buttons at the right time to destroy them and score points.  
Additionally, there is a slider mechanic in the form of a spline that the player must stay on using a rotary encoder.
